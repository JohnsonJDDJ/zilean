class SnapShots:
    """
    SnapShots is used for extracting interesting player data from Riot `MatchTimelineDto`s.
    SnapShots is a helper object that facilitates data analysis on League of Legends matches.

    The reason for the name is because SnapShots can extract player data from a match at specific
    time intervals, or `frames` (in minutes). Data at frames of interest can be used to, for 
    example, predict the result of a match.

    Arguments:

    - timelines: String, a file name where the source data are stored. The source data should
      be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represent one unique match. The
      dictionaries will have two keys: 
      - `id`: String, to indicate the unique match id of the match.
      - `timeline`: a Riot `MatchTimelineDto`.

    Keyword Arguments:
    
    - frames: List of integers, indicating the frames (in minutes) of interest. Default [8].
    - creep_score: Boolean. If True (recommended), then compute the creep score for the players, then
      drop the `minionKilled` and `jungleMinionKilled` feature of the players.
    - porportion: Boolean. If True, then add `goldPorportion` and `xpPorportion` as features to the players.

        Return the summary for all the matches (Riot MatchTimelineDtos). For each match,

        Keyword Arguments:
        
        - frame_independent: Boolean. If False (default), each match (Riot MatchTimelineDto) is
        one dictionary. If True, each frame (in minutes) of a match is one dictionary.
